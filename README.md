# Interactive Neural Network Made with OpenFrameworks
An Interactive, simple neural network to learn how neural networks work

## Installation
Download OpenFrameworks for your OS from the website or you can try and clone it:
```https://openframeworks.cc/download/```
or
```git clone https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/```
Go to the myApps directory
`cd openFrameworks/apps/myApps`
clone openframeworks-neuralnet
`git clone https://github.com/zyansheep/openframeworks-neuralnet`
`cd openframeworks-neuralnet`
Compile and Run
`make`

This was made on MacOSX and has only been tested on 10.13 Sierra
You will have to use the OpenFrameworks Project Generator to create a new project on your OS and copy the src folder over to compile.

## Usage
Click the neurons on the input and output to add training examples (press 'a' to add to database)

't' to train network

'r' to reload network

'c' to clear all network data

's' to activate training network async

'p' to print network data to console

'-' export training data to home folder (NeuralNet.bin)

'=' import training data from home folder (NeuralNet.bin)
